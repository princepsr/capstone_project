      We have various memberships types to suit your requirement. You will get
      the most value from fitness when it's part of your everyday life. That's
      why we offer <br/>a 6-month membership as standard. We also have short-term
      options available to get started with. You can pay for your membership as
      a monthly recurring<br/> payment or lumpsum all at once. You can also choose
      the date you want your membership to start, so you’ll only pay from your
      first session onwards.
